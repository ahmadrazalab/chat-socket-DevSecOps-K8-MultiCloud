# Kubernetes Chat Application Deployment

A production-ready chat application deployment configuration for Kubernetes, featuring secure HTTPS communication and multi-cloud environment support. This project demonstrates DevOps best practices for deploying scalable, secure real-time applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Containerized chat application with Socket.IO
- HTTPS/TLS encryption support
- Multi-cloud deployment configurations
- Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- Load Balancer configuration
- Persistent volume management
- Secret management for sensitive data

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application is designed with a microservices architecture:
- Frontend Service
- Backend API Service
- WebSocket Service
- Database Service
- Redis for session management
- NGINX Ingress Controller for HTTPS termination

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
- kubectl CLI tool
- Helm v3
- Docker
- SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- Access to cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kubernetes-chatapp-socket.git
cd kubernetes-chatapp-socket/kubernetes
```

### 2. Configure SSL/TLS

Create a TLS secret for HTTPS:
```bash
kubectl create secret tls chat-tls-secret \
  --cert=path/to/tls.crt \
  --key=path/to/tls.key \
  -n your-namespace
```


## 🌐 Multi-Cloud Deployment



## 📊 Monitoring & Scaling

### Enable Metrics Server
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is stored in Kubernetes Secrets
- Network policies are implemented for pod-to-pod communication
- RBAC policies are configured for access control
- Regular security audits and updates
- SSL/TLS encryption for all external traffic

## 🔍 Health Checks

The application includes:
- Liveness probes
- Readiness probes
- Startup probes
- Resource limits and requests


## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Pod scheduling issues
2. Network connectivity problems
3. Certificate renewal process
4. Resource constraints
